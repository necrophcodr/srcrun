# Srcrun

This project is mostly about experimental execution of simple C applications
without requiring compiled binaries (with the exception of the host shell, and
TinyCC).

The dependencies are as follows: TinyCC

And that's really it. Everything else is supposed to be handled by the
developer, allowing them to write their code, and simply execute it easily.  
This not only allows faster development phases, but additionally serves as an
educative look into simple C applications and how they work.
